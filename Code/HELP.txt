Clinical Anonymizer – Help Guide

This application lets you anonymize clinical and research PDF reports so they can
be safely shared with AI tools such as ChatGPT, while protecting patient privacy.
The main window lets you choose a source document, configure the output, select
a redaction mode and manage the list of sensitive terms.

Selecting a PDF document:
 • Click the “Browse” button next to “Source PDF Document” to choose the report
   you want to anonymize.
 • The application automatically proposes an output filename based on the input
   file name.

Choosing the output:
 • “Destination Folder” specifies where the anonymized PDF will be saved.
 • You can change the output filename in the “Output Filename” field.

Redaction modes:
 • Standard Protection – only the detected sensitive words/phrases are redacted.
 • Enhanced Protection – in addition to the detected words, some contextual area
   to the right and below the label is also covered to hide typical “values”.

Managing redaction terms:
 • Click “Manage Redaction Terms” to open the terms manager.
 • Use “Add New Term” to add institution-specific or project-specific labels.
 • Select a term and click “Edit Selected” to rename it.
 • Select a term and click “Delete Selected” to remove it from the list.
 • “Reset to Defaults” restores the built-in multi-language list.

Running anonymization:
 • After you have configured the input, output and redaction mode, click
   “Execute Anonymization”.
 • A progress bar at the bottom shows the processing status.
 • When the process is finished, you can open the output folder directly.

Reviewing the anonymized document:
 • Always inspect the resulting PDF manually before sharing it with others or
   uploading it to external services.
 • Check especially for:
   – Patient names and IDs
   – Dates of birth, admission and discharge
   – Addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
   – Local project codes or study identifiers
 • If necessary, refine your redaction terms and run the anonymization again.

Limitations and responsibilities:
 • This tool supports your anonymization workflow but cannot guarantee that all
   sensitive information has been removed.
 • You remain responsible for verifying the document and complying with your
   local data-protection regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA) and institutional
   policies.
